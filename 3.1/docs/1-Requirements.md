## 1. Requirements
### Introduction to the Lab Deployment Script
Along with this evaluation guide, we are providing a [script](https://github.com/vmware-nsx/eval-docs-ids-ips/blob/master/Nested%20Lab%20Deployment-3.1.ps1) which automated the lab environment deployment. This script makes it very easy for anyone to deploy a nested vSphere vSphere lab environment for learning and educational purposes. All required VMware components (ESXi, vCenter Server, NSX Unified Appliance and Edge) are automatically deployed, attacker and multiple victim workloads are deplyed, and NSX-T networking configuration is applied in order to anyone to start testing the NSX Distributed IDS/IPS as soon as the deploment is completed. 

Below is a diagram of what is deployed as part of the solution and you simply need to have an existing vSphere environment running that is managed by vCenter Server and with enough resources (CPU, Memory and Storage) to deploy this "Nested" lab

* Gray: Pre-requisites (Physical ESXi Server, vCenter managing the server and a Port group to provide connectivity of nested lab environment
* Blue: Management and Edge Components (vCenter, NSX Manager and NSX Edge) Deployed by PowerCLI Script
* Red: External VM running Metasploit and other functions deployed by PowerCLI Script on Physical Environment vCenter 
* Yellow: Nested ESXi hypevisors deployed by PowerCLI Script and managed by nested vCenter
* Purple: vSAN datastore across 3 nested ESXi hypervisors configured by PowerCLI Script
* Green: NSX Overlay DMZ Segment and vulnerable Web-VMs connected to it. Segment created and VMs deployed by PowerCLI Script.
* Orange: NSX Overlay Internal Segment and vulnerable App-VMs connected to it. Segment created and VMs deployed by PowerCLI Script.

### Physical Lab Requirements
Here are the requirements for NSX-T Distributed IDS/IPS Evaluation

#### vCenter
* vCenter Server running at least vSphere 6.7 or later
    * If your physical storage is vSAN, please ensure you've applied the following setting as mentioned [here](https://www.virtuallyghetto.com/2013/11/how-to-run-nested-esxi-on-top-of-vsan.html)

#### Compute
 * Single Physical host running at least vSphere 6.7 or later
 * Ability to provision VMs with up to 8 vCPU
 * Ability to provision up to 64 GB of memory

#### Network
 * Single pre-configured Standard or Distributed Portgroup (Management VLAN) used to connect the below components of the nested environment, in my example, VLAN-194 is used as this single port-group
 * 8 x IP Addresses for VCSA, ESXi, NSX-T Manager, Edge VM Management, Edge VM Uplink and External VM
 * 4 x IP Addresses for TEP (Tunnel Endpoint) interfaces on ESXi and Edge VM 
 * 1 x IP Address for T0 Static Route (optional)
 * All IP Addresses should be able to communicate with each other. These can all be in the same subnet (/27). In the example configuration provided the 10.114.209.128/27 subnet is used for all these IP addresses/interfaces: vCenter, NSX Manager Managenet Interface, T0 Router Uplink, Nested ESXi VMKernel and TEP interfaces (defined in IP pool), External VM.

#### Storage
 * Ability to provision up to 1TB of storage

#### Other
* Desktop (Windows, Mac or Linux) with latest PowerShell Core and PowerCLI 12.0 Core installed. See [ instructions here](https://blogs.vmware.com/PowerCLI/2018/03/installing-powercli-10-0-0-macos.html) for more details


### OVAs and images for the nested Lab
* vSphere 7 & NSX-T OVAs:
    * [vCenter Server Appliance 7.0.0B](https://my.vmware.com/group/vmware/downloads/details?downloadGroup=VC700B&productId=974&rPId=47905)
    * [NSX-T Manager 3.1.0 OVA](https://my.vmware.com/group/vmware/downloads/details?downloadGroup=NSX-T-310&productId=982&rPId=56490)
    * [NSX-T Edge 3.1.0 for ESXi OVA](https://my.vmware.com/group/vmware/downloads/details?downloadGroup=NSX-T-310&productId=982&rPId=56490)
    * [Nested ESXi 7.0 OVA - Build 15344619](https://download3.vmware.com/software/vmw-tools/nested-esxi/Nested_ESXi7.0_Appliance_Template_v1.ova)
    * External VM and Victim VM OVA - Links to these will be provided to PoV participants by their NSX account team.
* Preferrably, the deployed NSX Manager should have Internet access in order to download the lastest set of IDS/IPS signatures.
